description: "Wherever you are, we are coming for you..
Here we go for WTM Algiersâ€™s first edition of roadshow.
Our adventure is going to be within university campuses specialized  in various fields and high schools as well,  to meet you locally where a series of interactive conferences and tech talks will be held.
It is a fact that women are often left behind the sidelines of STEM fields. But women need tech and tech need more women. Especially that we see tech entering into every single aspect of our lives. So we are aiming through this event to spread our support and let people know that there is definitely a role for women in tech and it is sorely needed."
